# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Summary

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes a bacterial dataset. The dataset catalogs the top ten bacterial species in the volunteers' belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
